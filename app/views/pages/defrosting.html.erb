           Having only recently moved out of home, I have been cooking dramatically more than I used to. When I was living with my mum who also loves to cook, would do most of the organising and prep towards meals, even if I were cooking. In a similar fashion, my Dad keeps the kitchen a spotless environment where it is safe to cook, so I would never really have to worry about cleaning up either.

            <p>Defrosting meat is something that I never had to do at home because of how my parents took complete organisational control of the kitchen I was cooking in. Due to this lack of kitchen know-how I have finally encountered the painful task of getting back from a long day and wanting to use a chicken breast for a dish, but discovering that I have forgotten to take it out of the freezer, far too many times already. Subsequently I have also realised the process of defrosting meat leaves quite a mess which is irritating to clean up, as well as the issue of where to leave the meat for half a day, especially in a student accommodation kitchen where it could either be used or thrown away!

 We have been refrigerating and cooling food since the mid-18th century, and we have been using commercial freezers in our homes for the past 100 years. This means that the task of defrosting meat has been around for at least 100 years and is not something that myself alone has experienced. This Is an almost universal problem that a vast number of people have participated in.

  Scrolling through my Instagram feed I saw an advertisement for a ‘magical defrosting tray’ that will ‘save you hours of frustration and trouble’. My initial thought process resulted in me disregarding it as a gimmick that wouldn’t work and would be ridiculously priced. However, after one evening where I once again forgot to take a block of minced meat out of the freezer for a chilli I intended to make later that evening, I remembered the advert I had seen. I considered the reasons for this popping up on my feed and realised that as an Instagram advert it would have been targeted at a vast number of people, to present them with a solution to a problem. Through the lens of critical design, it was able to ponder that a counter point or alternative end had been achieved by conceptually altering the process of defrosting, to extract the cold, rather than let it dissipate into the environment. Using a thermo-conductive metal this idea has been executed and after using the product on a number of occasions I came to see how a collective need discovered through participation and engagement of the everyday person in a mundane task brought about a necessity for an alternative style of design. The combination of these two design
